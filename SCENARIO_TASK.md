# Enviro365 File Data Processing API

SCENARIO

EEnviro365, a leading environmental consulting firm, aims to develop a RESTful API tofacilitate file data processing for
their clients. The API will enable clients to upload text filescontaining environmental data for analysis and retrieve
processed results through simpleAPI requests and save the data in the database. As a software developer tasked
withbuilding this API, you need to design and implement a solution that meets therequirements outlined by Enviro365.

TASK

Build a Spring Boot application that exposes a REST API for clients:
• Design the REST API endpoints, specifying the request and response formats for
each endpoint.
• Implement the API endpoints Using a Java framework such as Spring Boot
• Test the API endpoints thoroughly to ensure functionality, reliability, and
performance.
• Document the API endpoints, input parameters, response formats, and error
handling procedures.

THINGS TO NOTE

1. All code should be written in a package 
2. com.enviro.assessment.grad001.yournameandsurname
3. From a technical perspective, as per commonly accepted best practice, each
   record has a primary key called "id" that identifies it - this is a technical id, and
4. Please model and implement the interface in the way YOU consider to be the
   best way from an Object-Oriented perspective. 
5. As we will be accessing a real database as part of this exercise, please
   implement an in memory database (H2).
6. Your submission must be a Springboot application with a rest endpoints
